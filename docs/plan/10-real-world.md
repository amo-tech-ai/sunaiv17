## 7. Social Media Marketing (The Viral Content Agency)

**Context:** A boutique agency managing TikTok/Reels strategies for 20+ personal brands.
**Step 2 Inputs (The Headache):**
*   *"My editors take too long to repurpose long-form video into clips, causing bottlenecks."* (Speed)
*   *"Our clients' DMs are flooded with leads, but we miss them because there's too much noise."* (Revenue)

### 🥇 Recommendation #1: The "Clip Factory"
*   **System ID:** `content_studio` (Renamed: *Viral Repurposing Engine*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** The bottleneck is "repurposing speed." The AI prescribes a system that uses multi-modal models to identify viral hooks in long videos and auto-generate captions/cuts.
*   **UI Badge:** "Production Saver"

**Generated ROI Text (What the user sees):**
> "Ingests 60-minute podcasts and automatically extracts 10+ viral-ready vertical clips with captions and B-roll. Reduces editing time by ~80%, allowing you to double your client capacity."

### 🥈 Recommendation #2: The "DM Setter"
*   **System ID:** `lead_gen` (Renamed: *Instagram DM Setter Bot*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** "Flooded DMs" is a good problem that becomes a bad problem if ignored. The AI prescribes a conversational agent to act as an "Appointment Setter" inside Instagram.

**Generated ROI Text:**
> "Monitors client DMs 24/7. Distinguishes between 'fans' and 'buyers' using intent analysis, and automatically books qualified leads into sales calendars directly from the chat."

## 8. High-Ticket Sales (The Coaching Program)

**Context:** An online education business selling a $5,000 mentorship program via sales calls.
**Step 2 Inputs (The Headache):**
*   *"Our sales team wastes 6 hours a day talking to prospects who can't afford the program."* (Efficiency)
*   *"Leads watch our webinar but don't book a call, and we forget to follow up."* (Leakage)

### 🥇 Recommendation #1: The "Gatekeeper"
*   **System ID:** `crm_autopilot` (Renamed: *Application Filter & Triage*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** The user is bleeding cash on "unqualified calls." The AI prescribes a strict pre-qualification system that analyzes financial fitness before a calendar slot opens.
*   **UI Badge:** "Sales Efficiency"

**Generated ROI Text:**
> "Analyzes application forms using AI to detect 'budget red flags.' Automatically routes low-budget leads to a downsell email sequence, ensuring your closers only speak to prospects with $5k+ buying power."

### 🥈 Recommendation #2: The "Show-Up Engine"
*   **System ID:** `conversion_booster` (Renamed: *Webinar Reactivation Sequence*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** "Watch but don't book" indicates a conversion gap. The AI prescribes a behavior-triggered follow-up system.

**Generated ROI Text:**
> "Tracks exactly how much of the webinar a lead watched. Triggers hyper-specific SMS/Email follow-ups based on their drop-off point (e.g., 'Saw you missed the pricing section...'), recovering ~15% of abandoned leads."

## 9. Affiliate Marketing (The Traffic Arbitrageur)

**Context:** A solo media buyer running paid ads to affiliate offers.
**Step 2 Inputs (The Headache):**
*   *"Ad fatigue is killing my ROAS; I can't test new creatives fast enough."* (Marketing)
*   *"Landing page conversion rates drop after 3 days of running traffic."* (Performance)

### 🥇 Recommendation #1: The "Creative Infinite"
*   **System ID:** `content_studio` (Renamed: *Ad Creative Generator*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** "Ad fatigue" requires volume. The AI prescribes a generative image/copy system to produce 50+ variations of winning ads daily.
*   **UI Badge:** "ROAS Booster"

**Generated ROI Text:**
> "Generates 50+ variations of your winning ad hooks and visuals daily. Automatically refreshes creative assets before ad fatigue sets in, maintaining a stable CPA at scale."

### 🥈 Recommendation #2: The "Dynamic Lander"
*   **System ID:** `conversion_booster` (Renamed: *Dynamic Copy Adjuster*)
*   **Why the AI chose this:** Conversion drops usually mean the audience is becoming blind to the offer. The AI prescribes a landing page that rewrites itself based on the visitor's traffic source.

**Generated ROI Text:**
> "Rewrites your landing page headline and bullets in real-time to match the specific ad creative the visitor clicked. Increases congruency and conversion rates by an estimated ~20%."
