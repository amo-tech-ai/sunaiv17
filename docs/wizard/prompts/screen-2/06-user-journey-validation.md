## 2. ANTI-PATTERNS (WHAT TO AVOID)

*   **Generic Questions:** "Do you want to make more money?" (Too vague, erodes trust).
*   **Technical Jargon:** "Do you need API Webhooks?" (Too scary, belongs in Readiness).
*   **Overload:** Showing 20 options. (Keep it to 5 per block).
*   **Dead Ends:** Selecting a problem that we don't have a system for.
