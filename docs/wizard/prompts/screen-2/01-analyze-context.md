## 1. DATA INPUTS (FROM STEP 1)

To generate an accurate Diagnostic form in Step 2, the system consumes the following **Verified Truths** from Step 1:

1.  **Industry (Enum):** `fashion`, `real_estate`, `saas`, etc.
    *   *Usage:* Determines which `IndustryPack` to load.
2.  **Selected Services (Array):** e.g., `['Shopify', 'Klaviyo']` or `['WhatsApp']`.
    *   *Usage:* Used to filter or prioritize questions.
    *   *Logic:* If 'WhatsApp' is present, prioritize questions about "Response Time".
3.  **Business Model (String):** e.g., "DTC Luxury Brand".
    *   *Usage:* Context for the Right Panel intelligence stream.
4.  **Maturity Score (1-5):**
    *   *Usage:* Determines the complexity of the questions.
    *   *Low Score (1-2):* Ask about basics (leads, manual work).
    *   *High Score (4-5):* Ask about optimization (CAC, LTV, API integrations).

## 2. ANALYSIS OBJECT

The `analysis` object generated by the **Analyst Agent** in Step 1 must be passed to the **Extractor Agent** in Step 2.

```typescript
interface AnalysisContext {
  detected_industry: string;
  business_model: string; // e.g. "High-Ticket Service"
  maturity_score: number;
  observations: {
    revenue_mechanic: string;
    likely_time_waste: string;
  };
}
```

## 3. FAIL-SAFE LOGIC

If Step 1 analysis fails or is incomplete:
1.  **Fallback Industry:** Use the user-selected dropdown value from Step 1.
2.  **Fallback Pack:** Load `GENERIC_PACK`.
3.  **Assumption:** Assume Maturity Score = 1 (Beginner).
