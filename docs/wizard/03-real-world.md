## 6. AI Agents & Features

### Agents Active on Screen 2
*   **Extractor:** (Main Actor) Ingests the Industry + Step 1 context to select/rank these questions. It doesn't *invent* them from scratch; it pulls from this "Pack" logic to ensure quality.
*   **Analyst:** (Background) Continues to verify specific details (e.g., if SaaS, does it look PLG or Sales-Led?) to refine the mapping.

### Gemini 3 Features
*   **Structured Outputs:** Essential. The questions must be returned as strict JSON objects `{ id, text, options: [] }` so the UI can render chips/cards.
*   **Thinking Mode (Gemini Pro):** Used to decide *which* of the 12 pain points to show. It picks the top 6 most relevant based on the user's website description.
*   **Search Grounding:** Used if the "Services" list from Step 1 was empty. The agent searches the company tech stack to guess (e.g., "They use HubSpot") and asks relevant questions.
